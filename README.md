✅ To-Do List App
💭 About

This is my second Python project — a simple To-Do List App made using basic Python.
It allows users to add, view, mark, and delete their daily tasks.
All tasks are saved in a text file so they remain even after closing the program.
I built this project as part of my Python internship to practice file handling and loops in Python.
